Purpose:
This repo is my submission for the "Explore US Bikeshare Data" project in Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. It makes use of the Pandas and Numpy libraries in Python to explore several data sets (stored in .csv files). The user is presented with a navigation menu, and the program responds to the user's input by displaying the appropriate descriptive statistics for the data set.
